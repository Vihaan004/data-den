## Project Setup

**Requirements**
- **Access to ASU Sol**
- **Interactive/remote session on a GPU Node**
- **Access to Ollama LLM**: default:/data/datasets/community/ollama
- **Pre-built Environments**: genai25.06, rapids25.02

Clone or download the repository or just the /App folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vihaan004/R1
cd App
```

Setting up the Sol Environment for the app:

```bash
# Load the latest Mamba module for environment management
module load mamba/latest

# Activate the pre-configured Conda environment for GenAI
source activate genai25.06

# Load the Ollama module (version 0.9.0) for local LLM serving
module load ollama/0.9.0

# Set the path to the directory containing Ollama models
export OLLAMA_MODELS=/data/datasets/community/ollama

# Start the Ollama server for LLM inference
ollama-start
```
Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the app 

```bash
python launch.py
```
